MistCSS is a codegen tool that takes __pure CSS__ and generates __type-safe__ and __error free pure visual components__.

By using CSS syntax instead of JS, __MistCSS greatly simplifies and improves the authoring and maintenance of components__.

It's also __zero-runtime__, meaning that exactly __0kb__ will be added to your bundle, making it very performant.

Unlike other tools, __MistCSS doesn't modify your CSS__, leaving you free to __use 100% of the modern features of the language__.

As a consequence, __you don't have to learn a new API__ to start using it nor have to install a code editor extension. __It's just CSS__.
