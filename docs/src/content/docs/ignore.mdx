title: Ignoring generated files
---

Since components are generated and shouldn't be edited, there's no need to version control, lint or have them in your code editor explorer panel.

Prevent generated files to be version controlled:

```gitignore title=".gitignore"
*.mist.tsx
```

Make Prettier not format generated files:

```gitignore title=".prettierignore"
*.mist.tsx
```

Make ESLint not lint generated files:

```js title="eslint.config.js"
{
  ignores: ['**/*.mist.tsx']
}
```

Hide generated files in VSCode (you can still view them using <kbd>Ctrl + Click</kbd>):

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/*.mist.tsx": true
  }
}
```
