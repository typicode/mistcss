title: Installation
---

```sh
npm install --save-dev mistcss
```

Assuming your components are in `./components`:

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "mistcss:dev": "mistcss ./components --watch",
    "mistcss:build": "mistcss ./components"
  }
}
```

You may want to use [concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) to run `mistcss:dev` in parallel with your dev server.

When building, `mistcss:build` must be run first.
